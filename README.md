<p align="justify">
I am a driven and passionate consultant and analyst, constantly seeking new learnings to solve the world's problems and make a meaningful impact. Currently, I work as a Senior Analyst in the Marketing Technology team at Loblaw Companies Limited. I'm a graduate student in business analytics at the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business. Before joining graduate school, I gained experience by working as an analyst for clients in the airline, pharmaceutical, retail and insurance space. <br></br> I am also a trained Bharatanatyam dancer. I have conceptualized, choreographed and performed across the globe. One of my noteworthy thematic performances was at Harvard University, Massachusetts. The performance, which was aplauded by all, showcased an abstract representation of the Lord of Dance- Shiva. <br></br>Apart from analytics and dance, I've also been an educator since 2016. I have been teaching <ul>
<li> English (spoken English and English for IELTS) </li>
<li> advance mathematics and statistics </li>
<li> dance (Bharatanatyam) </li>
</ul>
and have so far taught 50+ students from India, the US, Europe, Australia and Singapore
